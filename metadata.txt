Matlab file twitter_Breitbart.mat contains the following variables:

edges -- edge list for the co-follower network.
A -- weighted adjacency matrix.  A(i,j) = arc weight from j to i.
seeds -- structure describing the focal nodes, with the following fields:
	id -- Twitter id.
	inds -- indices of focal nodes in the edge list.  E.g. find( edges(:,1) == seeds.inds(i)) finds all followers of focal node i.
	names -- Twitter handle.
	nfollowers -- number of followers.
	communities -- community assignments following modularity maximization using a Louvain algorithm.
	party -- party affiliation.  Empty if none (e.g. for a non-politician node).


List of .m files:

analyzeTwitterGraph_Breitbart.m -- script which runs the calculations used in the Jan 11 blog post.
calcGraphLaplcian.m -- computes (unweighted) graph Laplacian from adjacency matrix.
calcNetworkRisk.m -- computes the PageRank vector without teleportation (i.e. the stationary distribution for the random walk generated by the Laplacian).
goModMaxLouvain.m -- runs a Louvain algorithm for modularity maximization.  The objective function is adjusted by a factor of 2 to account for a directed graph.

You will additionally need the GenLouvain files provided by NetWiki (https://github.com/GenLouvain/GenLouvain).
